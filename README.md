From the Google Play description:

Binaural beats work by playing tones of slightly different frequencies into each
ear. To be effective, they should be used with headphones and played just above
audible volume. The idea is that a beating effect will be created inside the
brain due to the difference in frequencies and the brain will synchronize with
this frequency. For the effect to work properly, the subject needs to relax and
let go while still maintaining a state of alertness. Sleeping with binaural
beats can also be useful.
